/**
 * A bandwith limiter. Conceptually, a bandwidth limiter distributes permits at a configurable rate. Each
 * {@link #acquire()} blocks if necessary until a permit is available, and then takes it. Once
 * acquired, permits need not be released.
 *
 * <p>{@code RateLimiter} is safe for concurrent use: It will restrict the total rate of calls from
 * all threads. Note, however, that it does not guarantee fairness.
 *
 * <p>Rate limiters are often used to restrict the rate at which some physical or logical resource
 * is accessed. This is in contrast to {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore} which restricts the
 * number of concurrent accesses instead of the rate (note though that concurrency and rate are
 * closely related, e.g. see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law">Little's
 * Law</a>).
 *
 * <p>A {@code RateLimiter} is defined primarily by the rate at which permits are issued. Absent
 * additional configuration, permits will be distributed at a fixed rate, defined in terms of
 * permits per second. Permits will be distributed smoothly, with the delay between individual
 * permits being adjusted to ensure that the configured rate is maintained.
 *
 * <p>It is possible to configure a {@code RateLimiter} to have a warmup period during which time
 * the permits issued each second steadily increases until it hits the stable rate.
 *
 * <p>As an example, imagine that we have a list of tasks to execute, but we don't want to submit
 * more than 2 per second:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * final RateLimiter rateLimiter = RateLimiter.of(Bandwidth.bursty(2.0)); // 2 permits per second
 * void submitTasks(List<Runnable> tasks, Executor executor) {
 *   for (Runnable task : tasks) {
 *     rateLimiter.acquire(); // may wait
 *     executor.execute(task);
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>As another example, imagine that we produce a stream of data, and we want to cap it at 5kb per
 * second. This could be accomplished by requiring a permit per byte, and specifying a rate of 5000
 * permits per second:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * final RateLimiter rateLimiter = RateLimiter.of(Bandwidth.bursty(5000.0); // 5000 permits per second
 * void submitPacket(byte[] packet) {
 *   rateLimiter.acquire(packet.length);
 *   networkService.send(packet);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>It is important to note that the number of permits requested <i>never</i> affects the
 * throttling of the request itself (an invocation to {@code acquire(1)} and an invocation to {@code
 * acquire(1000)} will result in exactly the same throttling, if any), but it affects the throttling
 * of the <i>next</i> request. I.e., if an expensive task arrives at an idle RateLimiter, it will be
 * granted immediately, but it is the <i>next</i> request that will experience extra throttling,
 * thus paying for the cost of the expensive task.
