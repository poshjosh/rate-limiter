### Introduce group `RateSource`.

We have different types of sources for annotation based rates.
This includes class, method and group rate sources. Both class
and method rate sources are represented by their respective 
Java constructs. However, group rate sources are represented
by a string id. We should represent a group rate source by a 
befitting construct.
